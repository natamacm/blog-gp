# Find all facial features in all the faces in the image
face_landmarks_list = face_recognition.face_landmarks(image)

print("I found {} face(s) in this photograph.".format(len(face_landmarks_list)))

pil_image = Image.fromarray(image)
d = ImageDraw.Draw(pil_image)

for face_landmarks in face_landmarks_list:
